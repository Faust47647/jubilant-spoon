# EKG and Heart Rate Variability Analysis

Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to providing MATLAB codes for analyzing Electrocardiogram (EKG) signals and assessing Heart Rate Variability (HRV). This project aims to offer tools for researchers, clinicians, and enthusiasts in the field of biomedical engineering and healthcare to analyze heart signals for various applications including health monitoring, diagnosis, and physiological research.

## Project Overview

This repository contains MATLAB scripts and functions designed for processing and analyzing EKG data to extract meaningful information on heart rate variability and other cardiac indicators. Our codebase is structured to support both beginners and advanced users in the field of cardiac signal processing.

## Features

- **EKG Signal Processing:** Scripts to preprocess EKG data, including filtering, baseline wander removal, and noise reduction.
- **R-Peak Detection:** Algorithms to accurately identify R-peaks in EKG signals.
- **HRV Analysis:** Tools to calculate HRV metrics such as RMSSD, SDNN, and frequency domain measures.
- **Visualization Tools:** Functions to generate plots and visualizations of EKG signals and HRV data for analysis and presentation.
